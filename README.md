# Maps, Waffle Charts, Word Cloud, Regression Plots

Programming Language: Python

•	The Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship, or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals.

•	create_wafflechart is created from scratch to display progress toward goals using Matplotlib library.  This function would take the following parameters as input:

    1.	categories: Unique categories or classes in dataframe.
    
    2.	values: Values corresponding to categories or classes.
    
    3.	height: Defined height of waffle chart.
    
    4.	width: Defined width of waffle chart.
    
    5.	colormap: Colormap class.
    
    6.	value_sign: In order to make our function more generalizable, we will add this parameter to address signs that could be associated with a value such as %, $, and so on.          value_sign has a default value of empty string.
    
•	Word clouds are created out of alice_novel.txt data using wordcloud library and superimposed the words onto a mask of any shape. Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

•	Created regression plots between ‘Total Immigration’ & ‘Year’ using seaborn library.

•	Created a scatter plot with a regression line to visualize the total immigration from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway to Canada from 1980 to 2013.

# Summarizing Sales Data 

Programming Language: Python

•	Imported 3 csv files- category_sales, date_dim, store_lookup & converted it into data frames using pandas library.

•	Merged the above 3 dataframes, identified the missing values(null values) in running_sales and replaced it with average value.

•	Created a summary table containing ‘channel-rollup’, ‘rtl_yr’, ‘avg_running_sales’ & ‘tot_running_sales’

# Twitter Sentiment & Text Analysis 

Programming Language: Python

•	Secured access to Twitter data using an application under Twitter developer account & extracted the recent 100 tweets from a Twitter user by creating an API object.  

•	After transforming into pandas data frame & cleaning, created two user-defined functions -' Subjectivity' & 'Polarity' to evaluate the sentiment of each tweet.

•	Using the WordCloud library, created a word cloud which is a cluster of words depicted in different sizes. The more a specific word appears in a source of textual data, the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

•	Classified each tweet as 'Positive,' 'Negative,' or 'Neutral' by defining a user-defined function getAnalysis() that evaluates a tweet based on a 'Polarity' score.

•	Created a scatter plot between polarity & subjectivity for all '100' tweets and a bar plot showing the value counts of Positive, Negative & Neutral tweets.

•	Split the data frame into strings to stem the words to their root using natural language tool kit Snowball Stemmer. After calculating word frequency, a bar plot shows the top 20 words used in the 100 recent tweets. 

•	Created a user-defined function show_ents() to scan each string and assign an entity to it & displayed a bar chart showing top organizations mentioned in the 100 tweets.
